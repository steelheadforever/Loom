# Loom Examples

Walkthroughs of Loom's core capabilities with realistic artifacts.

## Examples

### [Prompt Compilation](prompt-compilation.md)
How Loom transforms a natural language prompt into a structured task graph. Shows the compiled output, dependency levels, and how context evolves across iterations.

### [Parallel Execution](parallel-execution.md)
How Loom runs multiple subagents concurrently within a dependency level. Shows a security audit with 3 parallel reviewers.

### [Refinement Loop](refinement-loop.md)
The full iteration cycle from vague prompt to validated result, showing how each iteration discovers requirements, adds context, and converges.

## Getting Started

Start with [Prompt Compilation](prompt-compilation.md) to understand the basics, then [Parallel Execution](parallel-execution.md) to see parallelization in action.
