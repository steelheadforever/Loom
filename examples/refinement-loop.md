# Example: Recursive Refinement Loop

This example demonstrates how Loom iteratively refines prompts through automated feedback loops, progressively improving quality.

---

## Scenario: Build a Weather Dashboard

**Initial User Prompt:**
```
/loom build a weather dashboard
```

*(Intentionally vague to demonstrate refinement)*

---

## Iteration 1: Discovery Phase

### Compiled Prompt v1

```python
class CompiledPrompt:
    version = 1
    original = "build a weather dashboard"

    intent = {
        "type": "build_application",
        "domain": "web",
        "goals": [
            "Display weather information",
            "Create dashboard interface"
        ],
        "success_criteria": [
            "Weather data is displayed",
            "UI is functional"
        ]
    }

    tasks = [

### Iteration 1 Summary

```markdown
# Iteration 1

## What Happened
- Researcher found OpenWeatherMap API
- Architect identified missing requirements
- Architect made assumptions to proceed

## Issues Discovered
- User prompt too vague (missing features, tech stack)
- Cannot proceed without more details

## Improvements Applied
- Added context: weather API details
- Clarified goals: specific weather metrics to display
- Added assumptions: tech stack (React, Node.js)
- Added tasks: implement_backend, implement_frontend

## Decision
→ Iterate with refined prompt (v2)
```

## Iteration 2: Implementation Phase

### Compiled Prompt v2

```python

Changes from v1:
- Added context: weather_api (OpenWeatherMap details)
- Added context: tech_stack (React, Node.js, Tailwind)
- Updated intent: More specific goals (temperature, conditions, humidity, wind, search)

- Added task: implement_frontend

# Iteration 3

## What Happened
- Backend reviewer tested API endpoints (all passed)
- Frontend reviewer tested UI (all passed)
- Found 2 low-severity issues (rate limiting, loading state)

## Issues Discovered
- Backend: Missing rate limiting
- Frontend: Missing loading indicator
(Both low severity, not blocking)

## Improvements Applied
- Documented known issues in context

## Decision
→ Converged! Core functionality complete.
   Low-severity issues can be addressed later.

  - coder (backend): Built Node.js API server
  - coder (frontend): Built React weather UI

✓ Improvements suggested:
  - Add testing tasks

### Iteration 3 (Validation)
✓ Recompiled → loom/compiled_v3.py
  Added tasks: test_backend, test_frontend

## Evolution Analysis

### Prompt Quality Progression

**v1 (Vague):**
```
"build a weather dashboard"
→ 2 tasks, minimal context, blocked architect
```

**v2 (Refined):**
```
Added: weather API, tech stack, specific features
→ 3 tasks, clear implementation path
```

**v3 (Validated):**
```
Added: testing tasks, validation results
→ 2 tasks, quality assurance
```

### Key Improvements Across Iterations

| Aspect | v1 | v2 | v3 |
|--------|----|----|-----|
| **Clarity** | Vague | Specific | Validated |
| **Context** | Minimal | Rich (API, stack) | Complete |
| **Tasks** | 2 | 3 | 2 (testing) |
| **Completeness** | 20% | 80% | 100% |
| **Issues** | Many unknowns | Implementation ready | Production ready |

---

## Why Refinement Works

### 1. **Discovery in v1**
- Subagents identify missing requirements
- Suggest patches to fill gaps
- Make necessary assumptions

### 2. **Implementation in v2**
- Clear context enables productive work
- Subagents can execute confidently
- Suggest validation tasks

### 3. **Validation in v3**
- Quality assurance catches issues
- Minor problems documented
- Converged solution

---

## Convergence Detection

Loom stops iterating when:

✓ **No new patches suggested**
```python
if len(all_patches) == 0:
    break  # Converged
```

✓ **All tasks completed successfully**
```python
if all(output.completed for output in outputs):
    break  # Success
```

✓ **Maximum iterations reached**
```python
if iteration >= 3:
    break  # Max iterations
```

✓ **Prompt stabilized (v{{N}} == v{{N-1}})**
```python
if compiled_v3 == compiled_v2:
    break  # No changes
```

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Vague prompts are okay** - Loom refines them automatically
2. **Subagents discover missing requirements** through execution
3. **Each iteration improves** on the previous through patches
4. **Convergence is automatic** - stops when no more improvements
5. **Full audit trail** - evolution tracked in compiled_v*.py files

---

## Try It Yourself

Start with a vague prompt and watch Loom refine it:

```bash
/loom build a todo app

# Then watch the evolution:
cat loom/compiled_v1.py  # Initial compilation
cat loom/compiled_v2.py  # After discovering requirements
